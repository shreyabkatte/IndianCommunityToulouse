						<br>
						<p> <o>1. My valid ID would be my Titré de Séjour number on récépissé? And what if I apply for the number now, but I move in a couple of months to some other city for a job?</o></p>
						<p>Answer: Fiscal number is something which the tax office gives you. Apply for it where you currently live. You’ll have the option to change the address when you move to a different address. </p>
						<br>
						<p><o>2. I do not have a social security number since I was in France for 7 months and because of COVID I couldn't get it and had to move back to India. Can I still file tax?</o></p>
						<p>Answer: You need a Fiscal number for the tax payment (discussed in the first half of presentation: check the Youtube video). So, apply for the tax fiscal number using the 2043 form with all the available details via email. The tax department will contact you if there is some missing information including the social security number.</p>
						<br>
						<p><o>3. I am a student. Do I need to apply for tax? Currently I moved on to Aps visa. Should I need to start my tax declaration now?</o></p>
						<p>Answer:Yes, it is advisable to declare the tax when you are student or a jobseeker with APS.</p>
						<br>
						<p><o>4. I have already filed my income tax declaration and ITR in India (no income), do i need to declare it in France too?</o></p>
						<p>Answer: Yes, you have to file the taxes in France for the income in France and abroad.</p>
						<br>
						<p><o>5. I am in France since 2019 but haven't done this exercise ever. What happens if we do not declare tax?</o></p>
						<p>Answer: If you have earned money above the limits, you can speak to the tax dept and ask them to do a late declaration by paying whatever fines they ask. If it's 0 income, don't worry about it and just declare for 2020.</p>
						<br>
						<p><o>6. 2043 needs to be sent offline for the first time. Do you have an email/address for offline filling?</o></p>
						<p>Answer: The first part of our presentation explains how to get that email address. Follow our livestream which is recorded in our Youtube channel mentioned in disclaimers.</p>
						<br>
						<p><o>7. I was in my university city till my 3rd semester, for internship I moved to another city. In which department I should apply the tax file? I do not have any address in the old city.</o></p>

						<br>
						<!-- <p><o>8. I lived in France for 7 months and moved back to India. Is the process different if I do not live in France? Also I tried filling the form where I do not have a tax number and I get an error. I was employed from jan 2020 to aug 2020</o></p>

						<h2 style ="font-size: 36px; color: #1B15D1;">B. Student</h2>

						<p>Answer: It should be declared under section 1AJ as mentioned in the presentation. </p>
						<br>
						<p><o>2. Do the students doing part time also need to file the declaration?</o></p>
